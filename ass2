pragmas:
	- init
	- no. of procs
	- rank
	- send
	- receive
	- finalisation

Tasks: Sum of n using various mods:
1. "Naive" method
  - rank 0 master, send parts of the arr to each proc based on rank

2. proc_0: Broadcast entire array, proc_i: sums up it's part
	How to broadcast?
	MPI_Bcast(buf, count, datatype, source, comm(=mpi)): every proc
		calls this func. source is sender, every non source is receiver.

3. use reduce to combine the partial sums at each proc.
	MPI_Reduce(send_buf, read_buf, count, datatype, MPI_op, target, comm)

4. Use scatter to send parts of the array.
	MPI_Scatter(buf, count, send datatype,  ...)

5. Implement a new algo:
	- no. of procs should be taken as power of 2
	- size of array should be power f 2 (pad with 0s)

	- each process recursively keeps half the array with itself, and sends
	  the remaining half to the leader of the otehr half segment
	  => in log(p) stages array dist.
	- compute partial sums
	- each node sends to it's parent

	- check to see the optimal no. of processors required

	process data
	receive partitions
	compute final sum
} else {
